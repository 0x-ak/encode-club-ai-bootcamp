# Weekend Project
- This is week2 proeject from [Lesson-08](https://github.com/Encode-Club-AI-Bootcamp/Generative-AI-Applications/tree/main/Lesson-08)

## Prerequisite
1. Create a new application from scratch using NextJS
2. Add a feature for user to customize the Joke Parameters
  - Choose which parameters you'd like to offer your users
  - For example, allow users to select
    - A topic from a list of options (work, people, animals, food, television, etc)
    - A tone for the joke (witty, sarcastic, silly, dark, goofy, etc)
    - The type of joke (pun, knock-knock, story, etc)
    - The "temperature" (how much randomness/creativity to add to the joke)
    - Consider how you'll construct the prompt for the AI model to adhere to these parameters
3. After configuring the parameters, the user should be able to click a button to generate a joke based on their choices
4. Generated response must be displayed on the user's screen within the same page
5. Add a feature for the AI to evaluate if the generated jokes are "funny", "appropriate", "offensive" or other criteria you'd like to add
6. Experiment with different prompts and system instructions to optimize generalist AI models for "subjective" classification tasks like humor, appropriateness, offensiveness, etc.
7. Submit your project via the submission form on the course website
